In particular, tweets posted between 1 January and 31 May 2021 and containing keywords: ``COVID19", ``COVID", ``Coronavirus", ``Vaccine" and ``Mask" (string matching is case-insensitive) are considered, for a total of 986,446 (some of the tweets had been deleted).

## Format

The format of the csv file is:
